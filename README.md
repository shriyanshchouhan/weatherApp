# weatherApp
The React-based weather app leverages the OpenWeatherAPI to retrieve real-time weather data. Through this project, I honed my API calling skills and learned to parse and manipulate JSON responses effectively. This app provides users with up-to-date weather information, offering a seamless and informative experience.
